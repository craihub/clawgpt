# README Updates (Draft - pending testing)

## Changes to add to Security section:

### After "Visual Verification" row in the table:
| **Chat History Sync** | Your chats sync automatically between desktop and phone |

### New section after Security:

## 🔄 Cross-Device Sync

When you connect your phone via the relay QR code, your chat history syncs automatically:

- **Initial sync**: Phone receives all chats from desktop on connect
- **Real-time sync**: New messages appear on both devices instantly
- **Conflict resolution**: Newer changes win (by timestamp)
- **Offline support**: Each device keeps its own local copy

No cloud storage, no accounts — sync happens directly through the encrypted relay connection while both devices are connected.
